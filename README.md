# eve_fits_itemiser
Itemises fits for eve!

We get a fit and we format it for things :)

Test Alliance Best Alliance!

** Requirements **

Get fits from a .fit file ---> organised .item_fit file
Orders are compiled into a .order file and comprise of all
Orders can be formatted to have T2 items at the top and faction/meta at the bottom so manufacturers don't scream when sorting through it

It has to translate fits to itemised module lists
Itemised fits must be used to get total orders
An order uses itemised fits and a quantity associated with that
Each fit has a list of modules - their name and the number required
Each order has a list of modules required, their name and the number required from every fit * quantity required

The .fit is manually made by a user.  Sorry!

Order lists should include price (somehow)
Order lists should be exportable to Trello (if possible)
